# RayTracer

This will be a project that fully implements a Ray Tracer from scratch, following the steps in Peter Shirley's "[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)" Series.
<br>

I will be updating this README as I add more features.

Current Features:
Has some classes
Has a for loop that implements the basic concept of a ray tracer. Currently, the "scene" is just a sphere over a plane.
