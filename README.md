# RayTracer

This will be a project that fully implements a Ray Tracer from scratch, following the steps in Peter Shirley's "[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)" Series.
<br>

I will be updating this README as I add more features.<br>

Current Features:<br>
Has a for loop that implements the basic concept of a ray tracer. Plan to eventually move onto GPU for parallelism<br>
<br>
Camera configs for position, orientation, antialiasing, lens focus blurring<br>
<br>
Materials: lambertian, reflective, fuzzy (fuzzier reflections), dielectric<br>
<br>
Config is now customizable through command line arguments
